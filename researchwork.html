      <h3>1. Storm water Infrastructure design in southern ontario in light of climate change:</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Urban stormwater runoff management systems are typically designed to comply with
        established performance standards, relying on past climate data assumed to be consistent
        over time. However, with insights gleaned from climate change impact research, it becomes
        evident that these systems may soon be required to function effectively under altered climatic
        conditions compared to historical norms, reflecting the changing environment within the urban
        landscape. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of the observed hydroclimatic extremes
        are evident in many regions in Canada and around the globe. Consequently, new stormwater
        infrastructure design approaches are required to mitigate the effects of more intense and
        frequent flood events. The assessment of regional climate change impacts requires
        downscaling global climate models to finer spatiotemporal resolution and driving a hydrologic
        model to simulate land surface variables such as streamflow. This project assesses the
        impacts of climate change on the Batchawana watershed considering two innovative
        approaches: 1- it uses a statistical downscaling approach that maintains the spatiotemporal
        dependence between precipitation and temperature, and 2- it uses a large ensemble of
        simulations generated by the Raven model to quantify the uncertainties due to internal
        variability and modeling errors. Finally, current stormwater system designs were evaluated
        and new criteria have been proposed for future design and planning.

      <h3>2. Probable Maximum Precipitation under changing climate conditions in India region:</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration meteorologically possible for a 
        design watershed or a given storm area at a particular location at a particular time of year, 
        with no allowance made for long-term climatic trends.

      <h3>3. Identification of Construction Waste in India:</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Monitoring construction waste is crucial for promoting sustainable development and reducing environmental impact. 
        By keeping track of the types and quantities of waste generated, builders can identify opportunities for recycling 
        and reusing materials, which conserves natural resources and reduces landfill use. <br>
