      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Creation Of A Creature</h1> <br />
      <article>
        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why do i call it “Creation of A Creature”?</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, I enjoy symmetry, and as we can see, Creature and Creation both contain eight alphabet letters and begin with the letter C.
              Second, I was a Hindi medium student until 12th grade, so I was not good at English at the time. Then one day, after the celebration of Independence Day, 
              we were having snacks together with the headmaster and other teachers, and they just tried to check my English and told me to translate a sentence 
              called " मनुष्य एक सामाजिक प्राणी है”, But I couldn't recall the exact English phrase for " प्राणी " so I just translated it as "Human is a Social species." But 
              I wasn't satisfied with the term I stated, so I went to Google and found the word creature, which I couldn't forget.
              <br />

              <figcaption>Chit-chat during tea time</figcaption>
              Moreover, the term "creature" relates directly to humans, as humans are indeed creatures. This connection adds another layer of meaning to "Creation of A 
              Creature." It underscores the idea that humans, as creatures, are a result of creation, emphasizing both the creative process and the inherent nature of 
              humanity. This phrase encapsulates the intricate relationship between creation and the human essence, further highlighting why I find the symmetry and 
              meaning so compelling.

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
          <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Let’s begin the family introduction of our character”</h2>
            <p>A Gupta family resides in a house in the hamlet of Hanumangarh, a small village near the 
              city of Sidhi in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
              <br />
              Ram was the oldest son in the family, with two younger brothers and four sisters. When Ram 
              was just 16 years old, his mother died of cancer because she couldn't get medical attention in time due 
              to their difficult family situation. His father owned a small farm of about half an acre, but the income 
              from it wasn't enough to support the family. After completing the tenth grade, Ram left school and started 
              selling items in a small shop made from a metal container. He then built a mud house along the road and 
              opened a small shop there (the house with the farm was approximately half a km within the village's main road). 
              One night, while he was sleeping outside, a cat knocked over a chimney, causing a fire that burned down the entire 
              house and most of its contents. At that time, in 1993, there was no electricity in the village.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, Ram got married and used the dowry money to rebuild his shop.
            </p>

            <figcaption>Marriage of Ram</figcaption>
            <p>
              His wife, Rama, brought positive 
              changes to his life. Their first daughter, born in 1996, sadly died within a month due to health complications. The family 
              then welcomed two more daughters. Then, The family eagerly awaited the arrival of a son. Ram and Rama, a loving family, had long 
              dreamed of having a son in the family, and their anticipation grew with each passing day. The air buzzed with excitement as 
              their loved ones prepared to welcome the joyous occasion. <br /><br />
              Finally, the day arrived when their bundle of joy entered the world, filling the room with cries of new life. It was a magical moment as 
              the tiny baby, with delicate features and tiny fingers, was placed in their arms. Their hearts overflowed with pure happiness 
              and a sense of wonderment at the miracle before them. The date was May 23, 2003, and the sun was at its highest point in the 
              afternoon. The boy was born in his home because the hospital facilities were not available in the village.<br /><br />
              They named him Shiva. As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the child, named Shiva, became the center of their universe. Their 
              once quiet and peaceful home now resonated with the laughter and gurgles of their little one. With every smile that 
              adorned Shiva's face, their hearts swelled with immeasurable love and pride. <br /><br />
              After a year, the Birth ceremony was celebrated with great enjoyment. Then, the family distribution happened, and a small family of Ram, and 
              Rama with the Son Shiva and two daughters shifted to a home where they had their small shop of Kirana.

              Ram attended school up to the 10th grade, while Rama never had the opportunity to go to school. However, she learned 
              calculations by helping her mother in the vegetable shop. Although she cannot write, her memory is remarkable.

            <p>Shiva started going to school with his sisters. Despite his reluctance, he had to go because his sister had said she 
              wouldn't attend if he didn't. Rama would drop him off at school, but as a child, he wanted to come back home with his 
              mother. His mother would threaten, "If you don't go to school, the barber uncle will cut your ear," (the barber's shop 
              was right in front of the school) which kept Shiva at school.

            <p>Shiva was formally enrolled in school. The school had a policy where if three children from the same family were enrolled,
              the youngest child’s fees would be waived. Due to his basic understanding, Shiva was admitted directly into 1st grade 
              instead of nursery. Ram chose to enroll him in a private school called Saraswati Shishu Mandir because the village's 
              government school had poor teaching conditions. Additionally, Shiva and his sisters received home instruction from a 
              tutor. Shiva excelled and passed the 1st grade exams with the highest rank in his school.

            <p>When Shiva was in second grade, he memorized multiplication tables from 2 to 30, a feat even 8th graders struggled with. 
              This became a notable memory at his school. One day, he was called to the classroom of the 7th and 8th graders (due to 
              limited student numbers, rooms, and teachers, students from classes 1st and 2nd sat together, as did students from 3rd and 
              4th, and so on until the 8th grade) to check their classwork, where they had to write tables from 21 to 30. The teacher 
              handed Shiva a small stick, telling him to use it if anyone made mistakes. Shiva examined their work and found errors in 
              each one but refused to use the stick, despite the older students agreeing to be corrected by the younger boy and 
              playfully wanting to be disciplined by him.

              chunmun, go to the shop to buy a whole bundle, and then distribute it to everyone.

            <p>Shiva was in the third grade. On the 13th of December 2010, Shiva had his first half-yearly test. He received the exam 
              paper and notebook and began writing when suddenly a man riding a bicycle from Shiva's home side informed Shiva's 
              instructor that his Grandfather had died. Shiva's grandfather Shambhu had passed away peacefully in his sleep. 
              Shiva's heart sank, and a wave of sadness washed over him. It was as if a part of him had been torn 
              away, leaving behind a void that seemed impossible to fill. Shiva and his sisters were allowed to leave 
              and return home. Shiva was taken aback when he saw a dead body in front of him for the first time.
              Shiva's grandfather died due to a protracted infection in his legs that was not thoroughly operated on and did not 
              receive better treatment from a large hospital, and the hospital situation in the hamlet is as if there were no physicians 
              at all.

            <p>Shiva was moved to the 4th grade and was enjoying his school days happily. During a class led by Disha, the teacher, a 
              question about showing directions using hand gestures was posed. There were 15 students present that day, with 5 answering 
              correctly and 10 answering incorrectly. Disha decided on a peculiar punishment: those who answered correctly would slap 
              those who answered incorrectly, and vice versa. The twist was that the correct answers received two slaps each, while the 
              incorrect answers received only one. Shiva and his friends were too young to fully understand what was right or wrong in 
              this scenario. All they knew was that the teacher's statement was correct, even though the penalty seemed unfair. Shiva 
              happened to be among those who had given the correct answer.

            <p> Ram spent around 20,000 rupees on a used motorbike called the Bajaj CT 100. A motorbike has now been incorporated 
              into his home as a gadget.</p><br />
            <p> Shiva, a young child, often feels lonely because his parents don't let him play with other kids in their neighborhood. 
              His parents are concerned about his well-being and believe that keeping him away from other children who smoke and use bad 
              language is best for him, despite his desire to play freely. While I understand their concerns and their desire to keep 
              him safe, it doesn't make Shiva's situation any easier. He watches from his window as other kids play freely, their 
              laughter echoing in the air.</p><br />
            <p>Shiva couldn't resist going outside one day, and he was watching his friends play Gulli Danda in the streets when a gully 
              came and hit his forehead. At the time, he was at home where he was born (around a km from home where his parents were 
              living). His neighbors treated him by applying hot mix Turmeric and oil to his forehead, however, it swelled too much. 
              Now Shiva came home, but he was afraid that his father would rebuke him, so he tried to enter through another door. 
              However, his father discovered him and asked what happened. </p>

            <p>One day, Shiva was watching a bicycle and wished he owned it. He asked the owner, a 50-year-old man named Valmik Pandey, 
              if he could ride it. Valmik allowed him to. Valmik then suggested to Ram that he could buy the bicycle for Shiva for just 
              1500 rupees. After some conversation and seeing how happy Shiva was with the bicycle, Ram decided to buy it. Valmik told 
              Shiva to come home another day to pick up the bicycle because he was taking it home that day. The bicycle was one 
              typically given to girls from government schools. Now, Shiva had a bicycle.

              was off, pedaling furiously and embracing his newfound freedom. <br />

              The wind blew through his hair as he rode through the neighborhood, his laughter echoing in the air. Shiva's happiness 
              shone from within as he experienced the pure joy of exploring the world on his bicycle. The streets became his canvas, and 
              with each turn, he discovered new adventures waiting to be unveiled.</p>

            <p> Shiva's bicycle became his trusty companion, taking him on fun journeys to secret hideouts, winding paths through the 
              park, and exciting races with his new friends. His smile never faded, and he felt joyful with every twist and turn, 
              enjoying the simple pleasure of being a child on a bike. The world seemed brighter and more colorful from the seat of his 
              bicycle. Shiva enjoyed the camaraderie and shared laughter with his friends as they embarked on thrilling adventures 
              together. With each passing day, his confidence grew, and he discovered a sense of independence he had never known 
              before.

            <p> One day, Shiva was riding his bicycle and lost in thought when he hit a stone, lost his balance, and fell, becoming 
              unconscious. When he woke up, he found himself on a bed in another family's home, with a doctor treating him. He didn't 
              remember what had happened. His entire family was gathered around him. Fortunately, it was just a minor accident, and 
              Shiva only had a few scrapes on his face.</p>

            <p>Shiva's parents wanted him to be proficient in English because he was in a Hindi medium school, but the only teacher who 
              provided decent English tutoring lived approximately 3 to 4 km away. Shiva used to travel there at 6 a.m. on his bicycle, 
              pedaling across roads and farm fields. <br/>

              Once upon a time, on a morning, young Shiva was making his way back home from his tutor's house. As he rode his bicycle 
              along the road, he encountered a slight downhill slope that caused his speed to increase. However, his carefree ride took 
              an unexpected turn when he noticed a mischievous boy who had a habit of threatening others by trying to snatch their 
              bicycles from behind.<br/>
              
              In an attempt to avoid any trouble with the boy, Shiva swiftly changed his cycling path, veering away to the other side of 
              the road. But just as he did, a group of oxen suddenly appeared on that side, blocking his way. Reacting quickly, Shiva 
              had to abruptly change the direction of his handlebars, causing his bicycle to lose balance.<br/>
              
              In a desperate effort to prevent himself from crashing into a neighboring house, Shiva leaped off his bicycle, hoping to 
              come to a stop. Unfortunately, his face collided with the handlebars, and a bolt positioned in the middle of the handlebar 
              struck the top layer of his left eye. Blood began to trickle from the injury, and Shiva, filled with worry, couldn't 
              ascertain the extent of the damage to his eye.<br/><br/>

            <figcaption>Shiva returning from tution class</figcaption>
            <p> Despite the pain and uncertainty about the safety of his eyes, Shiva bravely placed one hand over his injured eye and pedaled the remaining distance of approximately 
              800 meters to reach his home. Tears welled up in his eyes as he rushed to his mother, who, at that moment, was unaware of 
              what had transpired. Unfortunately, his father, Ram, was also not present as he had ventured to a nearby farmer's home on 
              his bicycle to procure cereals for resale in city shops.<br/>

              With just one Nokia phone in the home, which Ram used to carry around, Shiva’s mother requested their kind-hearted 
              neighbors to inform his father about the accident. In the meantime, his concerned neighbors took Shiva to the village 
              hospital, hoping to receive immediate medical attention. However, upon examination, the doctor realized that the injury 
              was situated just above the eye, making it impossible to perform any procedures at the village hospital. The doctor 
              offered temporary relief by placing a cotton patch over Shiva's injured eye and advising them to seek urgent treatment 
              at a city hospital.<br/>
              
              Returning home with his patched eye, Shiva was met with an unexpected visitor—a herdsman who had witnessed his earlier 
              cycling escapade. Misinterpreting Shiva's zigzag riding as a display of skill and style, the herdsman shared his 
              observation with Shiva's parents. However, given the gravity of the situation, Shiva's parents chose not to address the 
              herdsman's remarks, their primary concern centered around their son's well-being.<br/>
              
              Ram drove Shiva to the city in a shared Jeep, where he discovered that the city government hospital would take 
              significantly longer, so he opted to go to a private hospital to receive urgent care for Shiva. The physicians at the 
              private hospital took care of Shiva quickly and thoroughly, and Shiva was sent back home the same day and healed within 
              two weeks.</p><br/><br/>
            
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">A frightful Night  </h3>

            <p> Once upon a time, rumors spread like wildfire through the hamlet and city about a terrifying woman who would visit every 
              home and tamper with the stone grinder. This stone grinder, equipped with a roller, was commonly used to make chutney in 
              Indian hamlets. The rumors claimed that the woman would manipulate the grinder, creating eerie figures, and anyone who 
              consumed the chutney made from it would meet a tragic end. It was also believed that if someone happened to witness the 
              woman's actions while she operated the grinder, they would face a similar fate. Additionally, there were whispers that 
              after using the grinder, the woman would make mysterious calls to homes, and anyone who woke up and heard her voice would 
              die. The rumors quickly circulated throughout all the villages in the city, including one particular listener named Shiva.

            <figcaption>Stone grinder and terrifying woman</figcaption>

            <p> Shiva and his mother traveled to their relatives' house in the city of Sidhi for a family gathering. After an enjoyable 
              party, everyone retired to their beds for the night. As the night settled in, Shiva found himself sleeping on the sofa, 
              while his uncle rested on the floor nearby. Suddenly, around midnight, Shiva awoke with a start, his mind flooded with the 
              terrifying rumors he had heard. He anxiously glanced out the window, consumed by the fear that the dreaded woman would 
              arrive. Shiva feared that if he were awake and heard her voice, he would meet an untimely demise. With this fear gripping 
              him, he struggled to find peace and sleep for the next ten minutes. Eventually, he made his way to the floor and slept 
              beside his uncle, choosing not to disturb anyone's rest by sharing his concerns.</p><br />

            <figcaption>That frightful Night</figcaption>
            <p> However, Shiva's movement from the sofa to the floor caught his uncle's attention, causing him to wake up and notice 
              Shiva's obvious distress. Worried for his nephew, he gently guided Shiva closer to his mother, Rama. Rama showered Shiva 
              with love and reassured him that their home was protected by a divine presence, pointing to a sacred sculpture as a symbol 
              of their safety. Filled with love and trust in his mother's words, Shiva finally found solace and drifted off to sleep, 
              waking up the next morning unharmed.<br/>

              Months later, the community discovered that a particular species of insect had been consuming stones, resulting in the 
              formation of unique sculptures. The deaths attributed to consuming the chutney were likely caused by the insect's 
              poisonous properties. However, the true nature of these events remained unknown to everyone.

          <div id="content9" class="chapter-content">
            <p>Shiva, both excited and worried, moved into the 8th grade feeling uncertain. His family was concerned about his future 
              because after the 8th grade, he would need to go to the 9th grade. There was only one government school in the village, 
              but the teaching there wasn't very good. The Excellence School, known as the best government school in all districts of 
              Madhya Pradesh, was his family's dream for him. There is one Excellence School in each district of Madhya Pradesh, known 
              for their high-quality education. However, getting into this prestigious school was difficult. Since Shiva didn't have any 
              reservation benefits, it was tough for him to get a spot. His parents worked hard to prepare him for the entrance exam, 
              and with hope, they submitted the application form. Shiva's headmaster was confident in his success, which motivated Shiva 
              even more.

            <figcaption>Ram thinking about his Shiva's future education</figcaption>
            <p> One day, Raj, a friend of Shiva's father, visited their home. As they conversed, Rama shared Shiva's plan to appear for 
              the Excellence school entrance exam. Raj, unaware of Shiva's potential, dismissively remarked that students like him would 
              never be selected for such a prestigious school. These words stung Shiva, igniting a fire within him to prove Raj wrong.
            </p> <br/>
            <p>The day of the entrance exam arrived, and Shiva, accompanied by his father Ram, entered the examination hall. After three 
              intense hours, Shiva completed the test and exited, feeling a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. They spent the rest of 
              the day together, visiting a relative in the bustling city of Sidhi before returning home. Shiva continued with his 
              regular school exams while enjoying the summer break.

            <p> During his vacation at a relative's house, Shiva was having a good time. When he got back home, his sister told him that 
              the entrance exam results had been announced that day. One of Ram's friends, Suresh, had gone to check his own son's 
              results and also checked Shiva's. He informed Ram that Shiva was on the waiting list. Overwhelmed with worry, Shiva 
              wondered how he would face his father, who had not yet come home. Understanding his feelings, his sister sent his meals to 
              the shop where their father sometimes stayed overnight.
            </p><br/>
            <p> The next day, Shiva gathered the courage to talk to his father about the exam results. The anticipation made it hard for 
              him to face his father. Shiva said he would study hard in the village and try again for the Excellence School after 10th 
              grade. A few days later, the next round of results was published, and Ram went to the school to check. The outcome 
              remained unknown, as neither Ram nor the school informed the family. That evening, Shiva's sister, Priyanka, called Ram to 
              ask about the prices of some ingredients for the shop. Casually, she asked about the waiting list result. This led to a 
              moment of joy and relief as they found out the good news—Shiva had secured a place in the coveted Excellence School.

              determination and effort, had finally shown results. As they enjoyed the happiness of this success, the family realized 
              that a new phase in Shiva's education was starting—one full of promise and countless opportunities. They also received

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">After 13th birthday</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">On the memorable date of July 4th, 2016, Shiva received official admission to the esteemed Excellence School for 9th grade. 
          Excitement filled the air as his educational journey was about to begin. However, a pressing concern arose—where would Shiva 
          stay in the city? Ram, his father, explored the option of staying with relatives in Sidhi, but their response was not 
          favorable. Determined to find a suitable solution, Ram decided to enroll Shiva in the semi-government hostel adjacent to the 
          school. The hostel charged a monthly fee of 1200 rupees.

          On July 6th, 2016, Shiva arrived at the hostel and completed the necessary formalities to officially become a resident. From 
          that day onward, he would attend school as a hostel student. However, on his first day of school, Shiva faced a 
          predicament—he had no school uniform. Ram had intended to purchase it that day but hadn't managed to do so. Undeterred, 
          Shiva decided to attend school in his regular clothes, but he wore the school tie and belt as a symbol of belonging. With 
          the tie and belt neatly in place, he entered the classroom after the morning prayers.

            <p>Shiva found himself in Section D, the last section for students from a Hindi medium background. The sections were 
              arranged based on selection criteria and would change according to performance in quarterly and half-yearly 
              examinations. As Shiva looked around, he noticed students from various villages and towns. Some students laughed at him, 
              but he remained unfazed, unaware of any faults in himself. Within minutes, their Sanskrit teacher, Hiramani, arrived in 
              the classroom to take attendance. When Shiva's name was called, he confidently replied, "Present, sir." Hiramani glanced 
              at Shiva and chuckled, pointing out that he was wearing the tie and belt despite not being in the school uniform. Shiva 
              understood the reason behind the laughter and promptly removed the tie, tucking it away in his bag.

            <p> The day progressed with different subject classes, and soon it was time for the fourth class of the day—the math class 
              with teacher Amit. As Amit entered the classroom, his eyes fell on the new faces. Approaching Shiva, he commanded, 
              "Stand up." Shiva rose from his seat, uncertain of what was about to unfold. Amit posed a question, a math query that 
              had likely been taught in earlier classes: "Where was Aryabhatta born, in Delhi or Mumbai?"<br/>

              Shiva, a regular student with no intention to deceive, took a guess and replied, "Mumbai." Unfortunately, the answer 
              was incorrect, as Aryabhatta was born in Patliputra, Bihar. In an instant, Amit delivered a slap on Shiva's cheek and 
              sharply instructed him to sit down.<br/>

              As the class concluded and lunchtime commenced, Shiva found himself in tears. It was his first day in school, and he 
              felt isolated without any friends to confide in or share his feelings.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
              In the evening, Shiva returned to the hostel. Ram had left to attend to other responsibilities. Shiva only had around 
              40 rupees, a small amount he had received from his mother before leaving home. Despite the setback, he managed to have 
              dinner, diligently completed his homework, and fell asleep, yearning for the warmth of his home and the comforting 
              presence of his parents.

              Little did Shiva know that this challenging first day would become a stepping stone in his journey. With resilience and 
              determination, he would navigate the trials of school life, make lasting friendships, and discover his own potential for 
              growth and success. The memory of that first day, although marked by tears and isolation, would serve as a reminder of 
              the courage he possessed and the strength he would continue to develop on his path to knowledge and self-discovery.

              All students in the hostel used to get two meals a day, one in the morning at 9 am and the other in the evening at 
              8 pm.

            <p>In the passage of time, a month had slipped by, and Shiva found himself engaged in a conversation with his roommate, 
              Prakand. Suddenly, Shiva's gaze fell upon a broken belt resting on Prakand's table in the corner. Intrigued, he 
              curiously inquired about how the belt had become damaged. However, the response he received was far from what he 
              expected. Prakand accused Shiva of breaking the belt and promptly reported the incident to the hostel superintendent, 
              Hari. Without bothering to listen to Shiva's side of the story, Hari swiftly decided that a penalty of 50 rupees would 
              be imposed on him as compensation for the damaged belt.

            <p> Determined to assert his innocence, Shiva resolved not to pay the penalty since he was not responsible for breaking 
              the belt. Unfortunately, he found himself without a listening ear or someone to advocate for him. Days passed, and 
              Shiva's hopes seemed dim until a fellow student residing in the adjacent room, who believed in Shiva's integrity, 
              stepped forward. With unwavering trust, this student managed to collect around 30 rupees and handed them over to Shiva, 
              advising him to contribute 20 rupees from his own pocket and present the total sum of 50 rupees to Prakand. It was a 
              pragmatic approach, preventing any unnecessary complications that might arise due to the hostel superintendent's 
              involvement. Reluctantly, Shiva agreed and handed over the money to Prakand.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the incident weighed heavily on Shiva's mind, he realized that sometimes it was necessary to compromise in 
              order to preserve peace and focus on his education. Amid the challenges and unfair situations he faced, Shiva's 
              resilience remained intact, reminding him to remain steadfast in his pursuit of knowledge. This episode taught him the 
              importance of patience, understanding, and the ability to navigate through difficult circumstances while staying true to 
              his principles. As he continued his journey at the hostel, Shiva embraced the valuable lessons learned and hoped for a 
              brighter future, one where truth and justice would prevail.

            <p>In Shiva's hostel, students were not allowed to have phones. However, they were permitted to make a quick missed call 
              home and only engage in conversation if their family called back.
              Shiva began taking private math training from a math instructor named Amit to improve his proficiency in the subject.
              One day, Shiva planned to visit home and decided to take the bus. To reach the bus stand, he hired an auto-rickshaw, 
              carrying a school bag and a small luggage bag with him. As the auto had few passengers, the driver asked Shiva to switch 
              to another auto halfway to the destination. Oblivious to his mistake, Shiva disembarked and got into the other auto, 
              heading towards the bus stand. It was then that he noticed his friends' bags and realized he had forgotten his own 
              luggage bag in the previous auto.

            <p> Determined to find his bag, Shiva decided to retrace his steps and went back to the market where he had last seen the 
              auto. However, he hadn't taken note of the vehicle number, so he searched through the backs of all the autos, but his 
              bag was nowhere to be found. At this moment, he encountered Krishna, one of his seniors, who happened to be traveling to 
              the same village. Shiva narrated the entire incident to Krishna, feeling a sense of despair and frustration.<br/><br/>

              Krishna suggested they walk back about a kilometer, hoping to find the auto. If they were unsuccessful, they would 
              return home, as Shiva's parents would be worried about him. With a heavy heart, Shiva began to walk back towards the bus 
              stand, his spirits dampened by the disappointing turn of events. However, as fate would have it, after walking for some 
              time, he spotted an auto-rickshaw on the opposite side of the road. To his joy, his luggage bag was safely placed at the 
              back. Overwhelmed with excitement, Shiva hurriedly crossed the road and managed to retrieve his bag just as the auto was 
              about to depart. Expressing gratitude to the auto driver, Shiva returned to his path and continued his journey home with 
              Krishna by his side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon arriving home, Shiva's father was understandably worried, having received information about the missing bag from 
              Shiva's friends who had already reached home. However, Shiva's safe return, along with the recovered bag, brought relief 
              to his father's anxious heart. The incident served as a reminder to Shiva of the importance of being vigilant and 
              responsible for his belongings, as well as the value of helpful friends like Krishna during times of adversity. With a 
              renewed sense of gratitude and the comforting presence of his family, Shiva settled back into the warmth and security of 
              home, cherishing the lessons learned from his eventful journey.

            <p>Superintendent Hari led a disciplined life with his wife, Devika, and their two children, David and Sameer. They 
              wielded authority over the students, and their influence was felt throughout the school. However, two days before the 
              quarterly exams, Shiva found himself at odds with his roommates, who were misbehaving towards him. Frustrated, Shiva 
              decided to approach Devika, the superintendent's wife, and lodged a complaint. In response, Devika arranged for Shiva 
              to switch rooms with another student named Gopal.

            <p> Unfortunately, the room change brought sadness to Shiva's heart. Over the past three months, he had grown close to his 
              friends, and now he found himself crying throughout the night, missing their company. Nevertheless, the next day marked 
              the beginning of the quarterly exams, and Shiva approached each test with dedication and determination. As the 
              individual subject results started pouring in, Shiva realized that he needed to improve his performance in English. 
              Despite this concern, he achieved an impressive score of 95 marks in mathematics, the highest in his entire section, 
              Section D.<br/><br/>

          <div id="content15" class="chapter-content">
            <p>On a particular day, a mathematics teacher named Dr. PC, who taught in English medium and was known for tutoring 
              10th-grade students, entered the classroom. Dr. PC inquired about the students who had scored 90 or above in 
              mathematics, and Shiva, as one of the top scorers, stood up. Curiously, Dr. PC asked Shiva if he took tuition from 
              Amit, another teacher known for coaching around 100 students from the 9th grade. Shiva confirmed that he did receive 
              tuition from Amit.
            </p>
            <p>
              To Shiva's surprise, Dr. PC alleged that Amit had shared the question papers with Shiva, attributing his high marks to 
              cheating. Dr. PC went on to present a question that Shiva couldn't solve, claiming that only he had taught that 
              particular method in his coaching classes. Moreover, Dr. PC proudly mentioned his PhD in mathematics and challenged 
              Shiva to prove himself in future exams.

            <figcaption>Teacher reaction</figcaption>
            <p> Undeterred by the accusation, Shiva, who was already skilled in mathematics, received a consistent score of 95 marks 
              in both the half-yearly and annual exams. Since the annual exam paper was directly from the MP board, no one could claim 
              any foul play or cheating, thereby disproving Dr. PC's misguided perception of Shiva's abilities. The consistent results 
              served as a testament to Shiva's dedication, hard work, and natural talent in mathematics, dispelling any doubts cast by 
              the skeptical teacher.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
              Shiva's success not only vindicated his own integrity but also shed light on the importance of resilience and staying 
              true to oneself. Despite the initial turmoil and the unjust allegations, Shiva remained steadfast in his pursuit of 
              academic excellence. His unwavering commitment to his studies ultimately silenced the doubters and reinforced his belief 
              in his own capabilities. Now, based on the quarterly examination, Shiva was shifted to section A with Rank 17 overall.

          <div id="content16" class="chapter-content">
            <p>One evening, during dinner time, David (Son of superintendent Hari) walked past the hostel doors, unaware of the unfolding events that were about to 
              take place. Suddenly, Gopal playfully called out to him using the name "Ghananand." David, upon hearing the name, burst 
              into laughter and continued to his room, finding the whole situation amusing. Little did Shiva know, he mistakenly 
              assumed that David's real name was Ghananand, as he was unaware of his actual name.
            </p>
            <p>
              On another day, Shiva found himself engaged in a conversation with his new roommate, Arun. During their discussion, Arun 
              inquired about the name of Hari's elder son. Shiva recalled the name "Ghananand" and relayed it to Arun. However, Arun, 
              being aware that David's real name was David and not Ghananand, took advantage of the situation. As David passed by the 
              doors, Arun informed him that Shiva was mistakenly interpreting his name as "Ghananand," the name of a Hindi poet who 
              was in love with Sujan.
            </p>
            <p> David, fuelled by anger, confronted Shiva, revealing his girlfriend's name and expressing his frustration over the 
              misunderstanding. He then approached his mother, Devika, and shared his concerns, believing that Shiva was tarnishing 
              his reputation. Together, David and Devika marched towards Shiva's room, scolding him for the alleged offense. Shiva 
              attempted to explain the situation, but their anger prevented them from truly understanding his perspective. Eventually, 
              they departed, with David requesting his mother not to inform Hari about the incident.<br/><br/>

            <p>
              However, Devika couldn't resist the urge to share the matter with Hari. She believed that Shiva's actions were 
              tarnishing David's name. Hari, upon hearing Devika's account, became consumed by anger and summoned Shiva to his room. 
              Shiva, filled with apprehension, explained the entire situation, hoping to clear his name. Unfortunately, Hari, blinded 
              by rage, impulsively slapped Shiva, leaving him stunned and hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hari, seeking validation, called Gopal to inquire about the alleged use of the name Ghananand. Fearing Hari's wrath, 
              Gopal denied ever referring to David as Ghananand. Despite Gopal's denial, Hari struck Shiva once again in a fit of 
              rage. In a distressing turn of events, Hari even reached for a bat, intending to harm Shiva further. However, witnessing 
              the escalating situation and the intensity of Hari's anger, Devika intervened, grabbing Hari's hand and urging Shiva to 
              retreat to his room.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shiva, left with no means to contact his parents and lacking alternative accommodation options, felt trapped and alone. 
              He knew his parents couldn't afford expensive hostels for his stay. In this difficult situation, Shiva grappled with the 
              aftermath of the incident, yearning for support and solace, unsure of what the future held for him.

          <div id="content17" class="chapter-content">
            <p>After several months, Shiva prepared himself for school and sat down on the hostel floor for lunch. Due to a shortage 
              of workers, the students were responsible for various tasks. On this particular day, the students from the adjacent room 
              were assigned to serve food to everyone. The plates were lined up, with a small gap left between them. Gopal approached 
              Shiva with his plate, asking him to shift a bit so that he could sit in the available space. Without hesitation, Shiva 
              innocently moved the other students' plates to make room for Gopal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unbeknownst to Shiva, Devika, who witnessed the plate-shifting, grew angry. In a fit of rage, she snapped a branch from 
              a nearby tree and marched towards Shiva. Oblivious to the impending danger, Shiva was just about to take his first bite 
              of food when Devika struck him forcefully on the back with the stick. The blow not only prevented Shiva from enjoying 
              his meal but also filled him with tears and confusion. He couldn’t understand why he was being punished for a simple act 
              of helping others in the hostel, where dictatorial behavior seemed to prevail.

            <p>
              As the stick was made of green wood, it left a dark mark on Shiva’s school uniform. Despite this, he went to school. 
              When he entered his first class, Amit M, an IT teacher who was fond of Shiva, noticed the mark on his shirt. Aware of 
              Shiva’s innocence, Amit M questioned him about the incident. Overwhelmed with emotion, Shiva began to cry once again. 
              Amit M then turned to Shiva’s friend, Gopal, and inquired about what had happened. Gopal explained the entire situation 
              to Amit M, shedding light on the unjust treatment Shiva had received.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Amit M sympathized with Shiva’s plight, he felt powerless to intervene due to Hari’s senior position as the 
              physical education teacher and superintendent of the hostel. Instead, Amit M expressed his affection and support for 
              Shiva, hoping to build trust and instill confidence that better days would come. He also urged Shiva’s friends to take 
              care of him during this difficult time. The class eventually ended, and Shiva, finding solace in Amit M’s kindness, 
              gradually began to heal from the emotional distress, attending his subsequent classes with renewed strength and 
              determination.

            <p>Half-yearly results were announced, and once again, Shiva showcased his excellent performance in school. One day, while 
              in the hostel, Shiva was chatting with his roommates. Their room accommodated a total of five students. In the evening, 
              Arun stepped out of the room briefly, giving Shiva and his friends an opportunity to come up with a playful idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, Shiva recalled a prank that the students in the adjacent room used to play. They would leave their door 
              slightly ajar and place a slipper right above it. When someone pushed the door open, the slipper would fall on them. 
              Shiva shared this prank with his roommates, and after a brief discussion, they decided to use Pragyesh’s slipper for the 
              prank.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as Arun entered the room, the slipper fell on him, catching him by surprise and making him angry. He noticed 
              that it was Pragyesh’s slipper and, already in a bad mood that day, became even angrier at Pragyesh. Furious, Arun 
              stormed out of the room and lodged a complaint with the hostel superintendent, Hari, about the incident.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hari promptly arrived at the room and summoned all the students to the courtyard. He demanded to know who was 
              responsible for the prank. Filled with fear, Shiva admitted, "सर, चप्पल तो Pragyesh की थी," then in a low voice, 
              he added, "लेकिन रखा मैंने था." Expecting to be punished, Shiva braced himself as Hari wielded his stick, striking 
              all the roommates except for Shiva.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the aftermath, Pragyesh, who had initially been angry at Shiva, realized that Shiva had truthfully explained the 
              situation. Understanding that Shiva hadn’t meant any harm, Pragyesh forgave him, and their friendship remained strong. 
              Shiva, however, realized that pranks can hurt someone and never played such tricks again.
